        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        In recent years, the advent of Artificial Intelligence has spurred the creation of various
        new technologies, one of which is the autonomous driving system. Among the focal areas
        of research, lane detection (also known as road mark detection) has garnered significant
        attention due to the advantages it offers to both human drivers and autonomous systems.
        These benefits include improved safety, driving comfort, and the overall efficiency of transportation systems. Nevertheless, present algorithms encounter difficulties when confronted
        with adverse conditions such as extreme lighting, low-visibility weather, and obscured lane
        markings. Therefore, the need to continuously develop and evaluate lane detection algorithms is necessary. To evaluate the performance of a lane detection algorithm under
        varying road conditions in practical settings, we need to utilise the front-facing cameras installed in vehicles equipped with lane detection technology. However, this method is both
        time-consuming and expensive, particularly for students. To tackle this issue, we propose
        a lane detection mobile app designed as an educational resource. This app offers learners a
        budget-friendly and efficient means to experiment with different lane detection algorithms.
        Compatible with various platforms, our mobile app currently enables users to capture images and select their preferred models to experiment with. The captured image will be sent
        to the server for processing and obtaining a detection result. Subsequently, the output image
        will be sent back to the phone for users to view. To fully utilise all functionalities of our lane
        detection mobile application, a strong network connection is recommended to expedite the
        request and retrieval tasks. Our app currently offers two lane detection models integrated
        into our system: YOLOP and YOLOPv2, as well as one drivable road region detection
        model, U-Net. In addition to the mobile application, we have trained several deep learning
        models, including three PSPNet models, each with a different backbone, for detecting lane
        marks, and one U-Net model for detecting drivable lane regions. The PSPNet-ResNet34
        achieved an F1 score of 0.72 on the VIL-100 test dataset for the road mark detection task,
        while the U-Net model achieved an 86.18% pixel accuracy score on the KITTI test dataset.
        
        <h2>About My Task</h2>
        In this project, I was the team leader. My responsibilities included coordinating team meetings and meetings with our supervisor. I was also in charge of training deep learning models for a mobile application designed to detect lanes. Additionally, I was responsible for writing the final group report and delivering the group presentation.
